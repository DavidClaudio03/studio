## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric lime (#B0FF00) to represent the fusion of technology and nature, embodying the cyberpunk-nature theme.
- Background color: Dark forest green (#1A2E20), heavily desaturated to ground the vibrant primary and give depth.
- Accent color: Cyber purple (#800080) for interactive elements and highlights, providing contrast and complementing the lime and green tones.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif with a neutral, objective look, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Custom-designed icons featuring neon outlines on dark backgrounds, in the cyberpunk style. Use a limited number of detailed glyphs for maximal clarity, and test frequently for WCAG compliance.
- Mobile-first approach to ensure responsiveness. Prioritize clear visual hierarchy for teachers and students to navigate the learning path and identify IA integration points.
- Subtle transition effects to reinforce a sense of futuristic smoothness and dynamism; ensure animations respect WCAG guidelines for accessibility.
